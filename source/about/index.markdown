ScribeUI is a mapfile editing tool first developped internally by [Mapgears](http://www.mapgears.com). The application is now being developped as a [Google Summer of Code project](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2013/jlapointe/4001), with the goal of sharing this tool to the community. 

This GSoC project is to finish the UI for Scribe, by fully supporting mapfile and basemaps filetypes, refining the GUI, test and fix bugs, clean the code behind and then package and publish the project as an open source utility accessible to all MapServer users, and user-friendly enough to appeal to both newbies and experienced mapfile developers looking for a productivity tool.
